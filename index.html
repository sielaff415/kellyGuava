	 	<h2>Diet of Sea Turtles</h2>
	 <body>

	 	<hr> <p>The loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley, hawksbill, flatback, and leatherback sea turtles are omnivorous for their entire life. Omnivorous turtles may eat a wide variety of plant and animal life including, decapods, seagrasses, seaweed, sponges, mollusks, cnidarians, echinoderms, worms and fish. However some species specialize on certain prey. </p>

The diet of green turtles changes with age. Juveniles are omnivorous, but as they mature they become exclusively herbivorous. This diet shift has an effect on the green turtle's morphology. Green sea turtles have a serrated jaw that is used to eat sea grass and algae.

Leatherback turtles feed almost exclusively on jellyfish and help control jellyfish populations. Hawksbills principally eat sponges, which constitute 70–95% of their diets in the Caribbean.
